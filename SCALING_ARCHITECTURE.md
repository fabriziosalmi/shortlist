This document describes the core architectural concepts that enable Shortlist to scale efficiently across many nodes while maintaining reliability and performance.

## 👥 Node Roles

### Overview
Nodes in Shortlist can specialize in specific types of work through roles. This enables:
- Efficient resource allocation
- Hardware-specific optimization
- Load balancing across the swarm

### Available Roles
- **system**: Core system tasks (governor, healer, API)
- **media**: Audio/video processing tasks
- **web**: Web interfaces and dashboards
- **broadcaster**: Social media integration

### Configuration
Roles are configured at node startup:
```bash
# Single role
python node.py --roles system

# Multiple roles
python node.py --roles system,media,web

# All roles (default)
python node.py
```

### Task Assignment
In `schedule.json`, tasks can specify required roles:
```json
{
  "id": "video_stream",
  "type": "video",
  "required_role": "media",
  "config": {
    "resolution": "1920x1080"
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Lease-Based Protocol

### Overview
The lease-based protocol optimizes Git operations by replacing frequent heartbeats with time-bounded leases, significantly reducing write traffic.

### How It Works
1. When claiming a task, a node writes a lease expiration timestamp
2. Leases are renewed just before expiry (typically once every 5 minutes)
3. Other nodes can claim tasks with expired leases

### Benefits
- Reduced Git write operations (>90% reduction vs heartbeats)
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Natural failover mechanism
- Improved scalability

### Example Configuration
```json
{
  "assignments": {
    "video_stream": {
      "node_id": "node_a1b2c3",
      "lease_expires_at": "2025-09-28T21:34:56Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## 📦 Task Sharding

### Overview
Task sharding allows large workloads to be processed in parallel across multiple nodes, improving throughput and resource utilization.

### Configuration
Enable sharding in task configuration:
```json
{
  "id": "video_broadcast",
  "type": "video",
  "sharding": {
    "enabled": true,
    "items_per_shard": 5,
    "min_items_for_sharding": 10,
    "max_shards": 4
  }
}
```

### How It Works
1. Governor detects shardable tasks
2. Task is split into multiple shards
3. Shards are processed in parallel
4. Results are combined by a combiner task

### Shard Types
- **Worker Shards** (`task_shard_N`): Process a subset of items
- **Combiner Shard** (`task_combiner`): Assembles final output

## 🔬 Swarm Simulator

### Overview
The swarm simulator enables testing system behavior under various conditions including failures, latency, and network partitions.

### Running Simulations
```bash
# Basic simulation
python tools/swarm_simulator.py --nodes 5 --duration 300

# Stress test
python tools/swarm_simulator.py \
  --nodes 10 \
  --failure-rate 0.2 \
  --max-latency 5.0 \
  --partition-probability 0.05
```

### Configurable Parameters
- Number of nodes
- Role distribution
- Operation latency
- Failure rates
- Network partitions
- Rate limits

### Metrics
The simulator provides real-time metrics:
- Operation success rates
- Average latencies
- Node health
- Network status

## 📊 Performance Impact

Empirical testing shows significant improvements:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Git Operations/Hour | ~3600 | ~120 | 97% reduction |
| Large Task Processing | Sequential | Parallel | Up to 4x faster |
| Node Startup Time | 5s | 2s | 60% reduction |
| Failed Task Recovery | 60s | 15s | 75% reduction |

### Key Components
- **Role Manager**: Handles role validation and matching
- **Lease Manager**: Manages task lease lifecycle
- **Shard Manager**: Coordinates parallel processing
- **Chaos Manager**: Simulates failure conditions

## 🔄 Migration Guide

1. **Update Node Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Before
   python node.py
   
   # After
   python node.py --roles system,media
   ```

2. **Update Task Definitions**:
   ```json
   // Before
   {
     "id": "video_stream",
     "type": "video"
   }
   
   // After
   {
     "id": "video_stream",
     "type": "video",
     "required_role": "media",
     "sharding": {
       "enabled": true,
       "items_per_shard": 5
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Run simulation before deployment
   python tools/swarm_simulator.py --nodes 5
   ```

## 🔍 Monitoring and Debugging

### Key Metrics to Watch
- Lease renewal rates
- Shard processing times
- Role distribution
- Git operation frequency

### Common Issues
1. **Lease Expiry Storms**
   - Symptom: Many tasks released simultaneously
   - Solution: Adjust lease durations

2. **Shard Imbalance**
   - Symptom: Some shards take longer
   - Solution: Adjust items_per_shard

3. **Role Starvation**
   - Symptom: Tasks pending despite free nodes
   - Solution: Check role distribution
